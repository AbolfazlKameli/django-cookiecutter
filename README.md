## Usage

Let's pretend you want to create a Django project called "StackOverFlow clone". Rather than using startproject and
then editing the results to include your name, email, and various configuration issues that always get forgotten until
the worst possible moment, get cookiecutter to do all the work.<br>
First, get Cookiecutter:

```shell
$ pip install cookiecutter
```

Now run it against this repo:

```shell
$ cookiecutter https://github.com/AbolfazlKameli/django-cookiecutter
```

You'll be prompted for some values. Provide them, then a Django project will be created for you. <br>
Answer the prompts with your own desired options. For example:

```shell
 
$ cookiecutter https://github.com/AbolfazlKameli/django-cookiecutter
  [1/18] project_name (My API): StackOverFlow clone
  [2/18] project_slug (stackoverflow_clone):

```
here is the example project I created: [StackOverFlow clone](https://github.com/AbolfazlKameli/StackOverFlow-Clone.git)

Enter the project and take a look around:

```shell
$ cd stackoverflow_clone
$ ls
```

‚Äúüéâ Surprise! I‚Äôve just set up a Git repository for you.‚Äù

Don't forget to carefully look at the generated README. Awesome, right?
